# Documentation Archive

**Purpose:** This directory contains historical documentation that provides context about the project's development but is no longer actively maintained.

---

## 📦 What's in the Archive

### `/phases/` - Development Phase Documentation
Historical records of major development phases (Phase 3, Phase 4, etc.). These documents captured the state of the project at specific points in time and show the evolution of features.

**Contents:**
- PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Phase 3 details and implementation
- PHASE3_VISUAL_GUIDE.md - Visual guide for Phase 3 features
- PHASE4_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Phase 4 details and implementation  
- PHASE4_SUMMARY.md - Summary of Phase 4 completion

**Use Case:** Understanding the historical development timeline and major milestones.

---

### `/sessions/` - Development Session Summaries
Logs from specific development sessions showing what was accomplished in each session.

**Contents:**
- SESSION_SUMMARY.md - General session summaries
- SESSION_2026_01_13_SUMMARY.md - Specific session from January 13, 2026

**Use Case:** Tracking day-to-day development progress and decisions made during specific sessions.

---

### `/implementation_summaries/` - Historical Implementation Summaries
Point-in-time snapshots of implementation status. These were created to document feature completion but have been superseded by more current documentation.

**Contents:**
- COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Comprehensive implementation overview
- FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Feature completion summary
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - General implementation summary
- UI_OVERHAUL_SUMMARY.md - UI refactoring summary
- WEB_APP_TRANSFORMATION_COMPLETE.md - Web app implementation summary
- FEATURE_VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md - Feature verification report

**Use Case:** Reference for how features were implemented and what the state was at specific points in time.

## 🔍 Why Archive?

These documents are archived rather than deleted because:

1. **Historical Context:** They explain how and why certain decisions were made
2. **Learning Resource:** Useful for understanding the evolution of the codebase
3. **Reference Material:** Can be consulted when making similar changes in the future
4. **Audit Trail:** Provides a record of the development process

However, they are **not actively maintained** because:

1. **Superseded:** Current documentation is more accurate and comprehensive
2. **Point-in-Time:** They represent specific moments, not the current state
3. **Maintenance Burden:** Keeping them updated would duplicate effort
4. **Clarity:** Separating historical from current docs improves discoverability
