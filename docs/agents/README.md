## For Now

Until this directory is fully populated, please refer to:

- **[../planning/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md](../planning/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md)** - Current agent workflow guide
- **[../planning/ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md](../planning/ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md)** - Prioritized task list
- **[../planning/TASKS.md](../planning/TASKS.md)** - Detailed task definitions
- **[../PROJECT_TIMELINE.md](../PROJECT_TIMELINE.md)** - Timeline and estimates

## Key Resources for AI Agents

### Task Selection
1. Check [PROJECT_TIMELINE.md](../PROJECT_TIMELINE.md) for overview
2. Review [ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md](../planning/ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md) for priorities
3. Pick task from [TASKS.md](../planning/TASKS.md)

### Implementation
1. Read task acceptance criteria
2. Follow patterns in [implementation/](../implementation/)
3. Check [POTENTIAL_ISSUES.md](../implementation/POTENTIAL_ISSUES.md)
4. Test thoroughly

### Verification
1. Run tests: `pytest tests/`
2. Manual test: `python main.py`
3. Check acceptance criteria
4. Report progress
