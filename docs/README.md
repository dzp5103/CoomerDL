## 📝 Contributing to Documentation

We welcome documentation improvements! When contributing:

### Style Guidelines
- Use Markdown format
- Include table of contents for docs >200 lines
- Use emojis for visual navigation (sparingly)
- Keep language clear and concise
- Include code examples where relevant

### File Naming
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for guides (e.g., `BUILDING.md`)
- Use descriptive names that match content
- Prefix with category if in root (`FEATURE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`)

### Organization Principles
- **planning/** = Future-focused (what we're building)
- **implementation/** = Present-focused (what we've built)
- **development/** = Process-focused (how we build)
- **archive/** = Historical (what we built when)
